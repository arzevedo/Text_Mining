### Chernobyl

Analysis of the screenplay of the HBO miniseries chernobyl.
- Created and written by Craig Mazin, 
- The series has 5 episodes and all 5 originals screenplays were made available once the series ended.
- You can find Mazin's blog [here](https://johnaugust.com)
- I just loved the series, so after my disappointment with game of thrones, i can give some prestige about ~~something that i really enjoyed~~ **good writing**.
